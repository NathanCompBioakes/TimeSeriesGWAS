<h3>Introduction</h3>
<center>
	The study of human population genetics has historically been an endeavor to infer evolutionary and demographic changes through time from data standing genetic variation between and within modern populations. If a temporal dimension can be added to the population data there could be significant improvement to current demographic modeling, allele age estimation and tests of natural selection [1]. Unfortunately this has been of reach for many scientists interested in human evolutionary history due to prohibitive costs to sequencing, technical challenges of sequencing and analyzing ancient DNA, and the small pool of samples with enough preserved DNA to be sequenced.  However, recently 230 ancient Eurasians have been sequenced [2], and that has data made public, so that potential for time series analysis of human populations can be made possible. Two exciting outcomes came from this publication. The first being that the ancient samples were dated from 7 to 1 thousand years ago, spanning the emergence of agriculture through Europe, which had such a strong impact on the environment in which these humans lived that there is evidence of some of the strongest signatures of selection originating from this period [3]. The second being that the authors found that modern Eurasians populations can be modeled approximately well as being a linear combination of a collection of ancient populations. From this dataset I hope to use a method of analysis that leverage the time component of frequency changes over time to infer signatures of selection.
